# Layer 3: Arithmetic Operators

## Operations as Chemical Reactions

Arithmetic Operators reveal that mathematical operations aren't abstract manipulations - they're chemical reactions between computational molecules. Addition merges field patterns, multiplication creates interference, and factorization is molecular decomposition.

## The Chemistry of Operations

### Addition: Field Merger

Addition creates field superposition:

```typescript
// Adding 7 (fields: I,T,φ) + 11 (fields: I,T,½)
// Result: 18 (fields: T,2π)

// The fields don't simply combine - they interfere and transform
```

Key phenomena:
- **Phase-dependent**: Result depends on relative phase (n mod 256)
- **Non-linear**: Field patterns can completely reorganize
- **Energy shifts**: Resonance redistributes during merger

### Multiplication: Field Entanglement

Multiplication creates the most complex interference:

```typescript
// 7 × 11 = 77
// 7:  Fields {I,T,φ},   Resonance = 2.975
// 11: Fields {I,T,½},   Resonance = 0.920
// 77: Fields {I,φ,½,θ}, Resonance = 0.161

// Field T vanished! Field θ appeared!
// This is a denormalization artifact
```

## Denormalization Artifacts

The universe's most profound feature: fields that appear or vanish during multiplication.

### Types of Artifacts

1. **Vanishing Fields**: Present in factors but absent in product
   - Example: Field T in 7×11=77
   - Indicates destructive interference

2. **Emergent Fields**: Absent in factors but present in product
   - Example: Field θ in 77
   - Indicates constructive interference

3. **Phase Locks**: Fields that maintain exact relationships
   - Example: Fields 4,5 in multiples of 48

### Artifact Mechanics

```typescript
interface DenormalizationArtifact {
  type: 'vanishing' | 'emergent';
  field: FieldIndex;
  factors: number[];
  product: number;
  interferencePattern: Complex;
}
```

## Factorization: Molecular Decomposition

Factorization reverses multiplication's interference:

```typescript
// Factoring 77 back to primes
// Must reconstruct: Which fields vanished? Which emerged?
// The universe must solve its own interference equations
```

### Prime Factorization as Norm Form

Every composite has a unique "normalized" form - its prime factorization. This is the universe returning a molecule to its constituent atoms.

### Computational Complexity

The difficulty of factorization relates to:
1. **Artifact complexity**: More artifacts = harder to reverse
2. **Resonance depth**: Deep resonance wells resist decomposition
3. **Field entanglement**: Highly entangled fields are hard to separate

## Division: Inverse Compilation

Division attempts to reverse multiplication's compilation:

```typescript
// 77 ÷ 7 = 11
// Must reconstruct field T that vanished
// Must remove field θ that emerged
// This is decompilation, not simple arithmetic
```

## Modular Arithmetic: Cyclic Reactions

Modular operations create closed reaction systems:

```typescript
// Working mod 48 creates a closed page
// Fields 4,5 maintain perfect resonance
// Lagrange points become reaction centers
```

### Clock Arithmetic as Orbital Mechanics

- Numbers orbit around moduli
- Lagrange points create stable orbits
- Resonance determines orbital period

## Exponentiation: Recursive Compilation

Powers create recursive field interference:

```typescript
// 7^2 = 49
// 7:  Fields {I,T,φ}
// 49: Fields {I,2π,θ}
// Completely different field pattern!
```

### Power Towers and Field Cascades

Repeated exponentiation creates cascading field transformations, each level compiling the previous.

## The GCD/LCM Duality

### Greatest Common Divisor
Finding shared prime factors = finding common field sources before interference.

### Least Common Multiple  
Finding minimal combination = finding first resonance harmony point.

These dual operations reveal the universe's conservation laws.

## Arithmetic Algebra

Operations follow algebraic laws, but with quantum corrections:

### Commutative (with phase)
```
a + b = b + a (exactly)
a × b = b × a (same result, different field evolution)
```

### Associative (with artifacts)
```
(a × b) × c = a × (b × c)
Same result, but intermediate artifacts differ!
```

### Distributive (with interference)
```
a × (b + c) = (a × b) + (a × c)
Field interference makes this non-trivial
```

## Computational Strategies

### Optimization via Lagrange Points
- Route calculations through stable points
- Use resonance wells for intermediate results
- Minimize field interference

### Parallel Field Evolution
- Different bit scales can evolve independently
- Merge results at resonance points
- Quantum-like superposition of calculations

### Artifact Prediction
- Learn common artifact patterns
- Predict likely field transformations
- Pre-compute inverse artifacts

## The Living Calculator

Arithmetic operations aren't performed ON numbers - they're performed BY numbers. Each number knows how to:
- Merge with others (addition)
- Entangle fields (multiplication)
- Decompose to atoms (factorization)
- Navigate phase space (modular arithmetic)

## Connection to Other Layers

### From Page Topology
- Operations respect page boundaries
- Lagrange points stabilize calculations
- Page transitions create artifacts

### To Algebraic Structures
- Operations create group structures
- Field patterns form rings
- Artifacts generate ideals

### To Calculus Engine
- Operations have derivatives (rate of field change)
- Integration accumulates artifacts
- Limits approach Lagrange points

## The Chemical Laboratory

The arithmetic layer is the universe's chemical laboratory where:
- **Numbers** are molecules
- **Primes** are atoms
- **Operations** are reactions
- **Fields** are chemical bonds
- **Artifacts** are reaction products
- **Resonance** is binding energy

Every calculation is a chemical reaction, transforming field patterns, creating and destroying information, following conservation laws we're only beginning to understand.

This isn't metaphor - it's the actual computational chemistry of mathematics, where 2+2=4 is as real and physical as H₂+O→H₂O.
