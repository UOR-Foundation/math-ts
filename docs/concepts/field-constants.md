# Field Constants and Constitutional Primes

## The 8 Fundamental Field Constants

Based on the mathematical foundations, the 8 field constants are precisely defined:

```
α = (α₀, α₁, α₂, α₃, α₄, α₅, α₆, α₇)
  = (1, 1.8392867552141612, φ, ½, (2π)⁻¹, 2π, 0.199612, 0.014134725)
```

Where:
- **α₀ = 1**: Identity field (I) - Unity, the primordial existence
- **α₁ = 1.8392867552141612**: Negation field (N) - Binary opposition 
- **α₂ = φ ≈ 1.61803398875**: Golden ratio field (φ) - Divine proportion
- **α₃ = ½ = 0.5**: Half field (½) - Fractional existence
- **α₄ = (2π)⁻¹ ≈ 0.159154943**: Inverse field (∞⁻¹) - Inverted transcendence
- **α₅ = 2π ≈ 6.283185307**: Transcendence field (T) - Circular transcendence
- **α₆ = 0.199612**: Prime field (P) - Primality essence
- **α₇ = 0.014134725**: Zeta field (ζ) - Related to Riemann zeta function

## Critical Relationships

### Perfect Resonance Condition
Fields 4 and 5 together contribute:
```
α₄ × α₅ = (2π)⁻¹ × 2π = 1
```

This perfect resonance creates the 48-number page structure, since the minimal unsigned byte with both bits 4&5 set is `0b00110000 = 48`.

### Constitutional Prime Encoding
These constants are encoded by the constitutional primes: 2, 5, 7, 23, 107, 211, 379, 1321, 7129.

The universe bootstraps itself through these primes which define the field constants which determine which numbers are prime - a perfect circular self-reference.

## Field Activation Pattern

Every integer n has an 8-bit activation pattern determined by:
```
β(n) = (b₀(n), b₁(n), ..., b₇(n))
where bᵢ(n) = ⌊n/2ⁱ⌋ mod 2
```

This gives n mod 256 as an 8-bit pattern, cycling every 256 numbers.

## Resonance Calculation

The resonance (computational mass/energy) of a number is:
```
Res(n) = ∏ᵢ₌₀⁷ αᵢ^(bᵢ(n))
```

This is the product of all active field constants for that number.

## Implications

- Numbers are programs, not data
- Every number has exactly one field activation pattern
- Resonance determines computational properties
- The universe is self-defining through constitutional primes
