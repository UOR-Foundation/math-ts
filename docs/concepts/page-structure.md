# Page Structure and Lagrange Points

## The 48-Number Molecular Structure

The Mathematical Universe organizes integers into 48-number "pages" that form the basic molecular structure of mathematical space.

### Page Definition

Every integer n can be uniquely decomposed as:

```
n = λ·p(n) + k(n)
where λ = 48, p(n) ∈ ℤ, k(n) ∈ {0, 1, ..., 47}
```

- **page(n)** = p(n): Which page contains n
- **offset(n)** = k(n): Position within the page (0-47)

The sets:

```
𝒫ₚ = {λp, λp+1, ..., λp+47}
```

are called **pages** and satisfy: ℤ = ⋃ₚ∈ℤ 𝒫ₚ

### Why 48?

The page size emerges from the perfect resonance condition:

- Fields 4 and 5 together contribute α₄α₅ = (2π)⁻¹(2π) = 1
- The minimal unsigned byte with both bits 4&5 set is 0b00110000 = 48
- This creates computational stability at regular intervals

## Lagrange Points: Computational Stability Wells

### Primary Lagrange Points (𝓛₀)

The primary Lagrange points are:

```
𝓛₀ = {Λq, Λq+1, Λq+48, Λq+49 | q ∈ ℤ}
where Λ = 256 (cycle length)
```

Properties:

- Both bits 4&5 are active
- Resonance = 1.0 (perfect computational stability)
- These are "perfect wells" in the computational landscape

### Secondary Wells

| Name                | Condition                 | Resonance Feature                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Tribonacci well** | b₁=1, other high bits off | Local minimum, recursion cluster |
| **Golden well**     | b₂=1, others off          | φ-harmonic resonance             |
| **Deep-ζ well**     | b₇=1                      | Rare, high entropy               |

### Well Detection

A computational well occurs at n where the discrete Laplacian is positive:

```
Δ²Res(n) = Res(n+1) - 2Res(n) + Res(n-1) > 0
```

## Page Metrics and Geometry

### Field-Space Hamming Metric

```
d_Σ(m,n) = Σᵢ₌₀⁷ |bᵢ(m) - bᵢ(n)|
```

### Resonance Metric

```
d_R(m,n) = |Res(m) - Res(n)|
```

### Page Metric

```
d_P(m,n) = |offset(m) - offset(n)|
```

### Composite Computational Metric

```
d(m,n) = √(w_P d_P² + w_R d_R² + w_Σ d_Σ²)
```

## Conservation Laws

### Field-Parity Conservation

For every page 𝒫ₚ:

```
Σₙ∈𝒫ₚ β(n) ≡ (1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0) (mod 2)
```

The XOR of all activation vectors in a page is fixed - a Noether-like invariant.

### Resonance Flux Conservation

```
Φₚ = Σₙ∈𝒫ₚ ΔRes(n) = 0
```

Resonance is "solenoidal" - flux through each page sums to zero.

## Computational Cost Model

| Operation | Result Location                           | Cost Rule                          |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| m + n     | Same page if d_P(m,n) ≤ 47, else adjacent | Crossing 47→0 incurs ~1.3× latency |
| m × n     | page(m) + page(n) (mod λ)                 | Products in 𝓛₀ halve factor-time   |
| m mod λ   | Always within current page                | 𝓛₀ offsets act as hash buckets     |

## Implications

- Numbers organize into discrete "molecules" of 48
- Lagrange points provide computational stability
- Page boundaries create computational barriers
- Conservation laws govern all operations
- Geometry emerges from computational structure
