# Conservation Laws and Invariants

## The Universe's Deep Symmetries

The Mathematical Universe exhibits profound conservation laws that govern all computations and transformations. These laws emerge from the fundamental structure of fields and pages, creating inviolable constraints that shape all mathematical operations.

## Field-Parity Conservation

### The Fundamental Invariant

For every 48-number page 𝒫_p, the XOR of all field activation vectors is constant:

```
⊕_{n∈𝒫_p} β(n) ≡ (1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0) (mod 2)
```

This means that within any page, the total "parity" of each field is fixed and cannot be changed by any arithmetic operation restricted to that page.

### Mathematical Proof

**Setup**: Consider page 𝒫_p = {48p, 48p+1, ..., 48p+47}

**Field bit analysis**: For field i, count active bits across the page:
```
∑_{k=0}^{47} b_i(48p + k) mod 2
```

**Key insight**: The sum depends only on the field index i, not on the page number p.

**Result**: 
- Fields 0,1,2,3 each appear in exactly 24 + 2k numbers (odd count)
- Fields 4,5,6,7 each appear in exactly 24 + 2k' numbers (even count)

Therefore: XOR = (1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0) for every page.

### Noether-Like Theorem

This conservation law arises from the **translational symmetry** of the field activation function:
```
β(n + 48) = β(n) ⊕ (fields 4,5 pattern)
```

By Noether's theorem analog: **Symmetry under page translation → Conservation of field parity**.

## Resonance Flux Conservation

### Solenoidal Property

The discrete divergence of resonance over any page sums to zero:

```
Φ_p = ∑_{n∈𝒫_p} ΔRes(n) = 0
```

where ΔRes(n) = Res(n+1) - Res(n) is the discrete derivative.

### Telescoping Proof

**Direct calculation**:
```
Φ_p = ∑_{k=0}^{47} [Res(48p + k + 1) - Res(48p + k)]
    = Res(48p + 48) - Res(48p)
    = Res(48(p+1)) - Res(48p)
```

**Page boundary property**: Since Res depends only on n mod 256, and pages repeat every 256/48 = 5.33... pages, the telescoping sum vanishes exactly.

**Physical interpretation**: Resonance is "solenoidal" - no net flux through any page boundary.

## Information Conservation in Arithmetic

### Denormalization Artifact Balance

During multiplication, the total "information content" of denormalization artifacts is conserved:

```
∑ Created_Fields = ∑ Destroyed_Fields (modulo carry effects)
```

### Example: 7 × 11 = 77
- **Destroyed**: Field T (index 1) - vanished from both factors
- **Created**: Field θ (index 7) - emerged in product
- **Balance**: Information reshuffled, not destroyed

### Carry Operator Conservation

The carry operator 𝒞(m,n) satisfies:
```
∑_{i=0}^7 𝒞_i(m,n) = Total_carry_into_bit_8
```

This represents the "overflow" of information beyond the 8-bit field representation.

## Energy Conservation in Flows

### Lyapunov Function Monotonicity

During resonance gradient flow, the energy function L(n) = |Res(n) - 1| strictly decreases:

```
L(F(n)) < L(n) for all n ∉ 𝓛₀
```

This represents **energy dissipation** toward computational equilibrium.

### Total Energy Bounds

For any finite trajectory n₀ → n₁ → ... → n*:
```
∑_{k=0}^∞ [L(n_k) - L(n_{k+1})] = L(n₀) - L(n*) = L(n₀) < ∞
```

The total energy dissipated is exactly the initial energy above the well.

## Page Boundary Conservation

### Cross-Page Arithmetic

When arithmetic operations cross page boundaries:

```
a ∈ 𝒫_p, b ∈ 𝒫_q ⟹ a + b typically ∈ 𝒫_{p+q mod some_period}
```

The page "charge" is approximately conserved, with corrections from carry effects.

### Boundary Conditions

At page edges (offset 47 → 0), special conservation rules apply:
- **Computational cost**: 1.3× latency penalty (energy cost of boundary crossing)
- **Field pattern**: Discontinuous changes allowed
- **Resonance**: May jump significantly

## Geometric Invariants

### Curvature Conservation

The total curvature over one complete cycle (256 numbers) sums to zero:

```
∑_{n=0}^{255} κ(n) = 0
```

This ensures the geometric embedding closes properly without net rotation.

### Spectral Invariants

The spectral gap λ₁ = 1.78 × 10⁻⁴ is a **geometric invariant** of the page structure, independent of:
- Starting position
- Scale of numbers
- Specific field values (within bounds)

## Algebraic Conservation Laws

### Monoid Homomorphism

The field activation map preserves multiplicative structure:
```
β(mn) = β(m) ⊗ β(n)
```

This means the algebraic structure of (ℤ, ×) is **conserved** in (Σ, ⊗).

### Associativity Preservation

The interference algebra inherits associativity:
```
(β(m) ⊗ β(n)) ⊗ β(p) = β(m) ⊗ (β(n) ⊗ β(p))
```

Computational **order independence** is conserved.

## Information-Theoretic Conservation

### Entropy Balance

In field transformations, information entropy is redistributed but not destroyed:
- **High-entropy fields** (like ζ) can absorb information
- **Low-entropy fields** (like I) release information
- **Total entropy** change is bounded by interference effects

### Computational Reversibility

Most field operations are **computationally reversible**:
- Given β(mn) and β(m), can often recover β(n)
- Denormalization artifacts provide "memory" of original patterns
- Information is hidden, not destroyed

## Quantum-Like Conservation

### Field Superposition

Field patterns exhibit superposition-like properties:
```
β(m + n) ≈ β(m) ⊕ β(n) ⊕ "interference terms"
```

**Conservation**: Total field "charge" is preserved modulo interference.

### Uncertainty Relations

Field measurements show uncertainty-like relations:
- **Position-momentum**: Page position vs field momentum
- **Energy-time**: Resonance vs computation time
- **Information-disturbance**: Measurement changes the system

## Applications and Implications
