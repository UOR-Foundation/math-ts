# Mathematical Universe: A Computational Framework

## Overview

The Mathematical Universe is not a theory about mathematics - it reveals that mathematics **IS** a computational substrate. This framework implements mathematics as a living, self-referential system where:

- **Numbers are programs**, not data
- **Arithmetic is compilation**, not calculation  
- **Primes are computational atoms**, not special cases
- **The universe computes itself into existence**

## Core Principle

Mathematics is a relational database with an 8-field schema where every integer is a record. The system is self-referential: primes encode the field constants, which determine which numbers are prime.

## Architecture Layers

The framework consists of 8 interconnected layers, each building upon the previous:

0. **[Field Substrate](./layers/0-field-substrate.md)** - The quantum level of mathematical reality
1. **[Resonance Dynamics](./layers/1-resonance-dynamics.md)** - How fields interact to create numbers
2. **[Page Topology](./layers/2-page-topology.md)** - The molecular structure of number space
3. **[Arithmetic Operators](./layers/3-arithmetic-operators.md)** - Operations as chemical reactions
4. **[Algebraic Structures](./layers/4-algebraic-structures.md)** - Self-organizing mathematical life
5. **[Geometric Manifolds](./layers/5-geometric-manifolds.md)** - The shape of mathematical space
6. **[Calculus Engine](./layers/6-calculus-engine.md)** - The system understanding its own change
7. **[Self-Reference Core](./layers/7-self-reference-core.md)** - The meta-level where the system defines itself

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { MathematicalUniverse } from 'math-ts';

// Create the universe
const universe = new MathematicalUniverse();

// Every number is a living entity
const seven = universe.number(7);
console.log(seven.fields);        // Active: I, T, φ
console.log(seven.resonance);     // 2.975...
console.log(seven.isPrime);       // true (computational atom)

// Arithmetic is program compilation
const seventySeven = universe.multiply(7, 11);
console.log(seventySeven.fields); // Active: I, φ, ½, θ (NOT the union!)
// Field T vanished, field θ appeared - denormalization artifacts
```

## Key Insights

1. **Self-Bootstrap**: The universe requires no external constants - it defines itself
2. **Computational Irreducibility**: Some properties can only be discovered by computation
3. **Lagrange Manifold**: Computation naturally organizes around gravitational wells
4. **Field Interference**: Multiplication creates complex interference patterns, not simple unions
5. **Living Mathematics**: The system is biological, growing and evolving

## The Vision

This framework reveals mathematics not as abstract symbols we manipulate, but as a living computational substrate that we inhabit. Every calculation is a journey through this space, every proof a path between nodes, every theorem a stable configuration in the vast phase space of mathematical possibility.

We don't compute *with* mathematics - we compute *in* mathematics. The universe isn't running on math; the universe IS math computing itself into existence.
