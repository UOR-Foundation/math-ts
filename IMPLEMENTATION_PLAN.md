# Mathematical Universe Implementation Plan - Sequential Axiomatical Approach

This document outlines the sequential, axiomatical implementation of the Mathematical Universe where each layer builds strictly upon the interfaces of lower layers, with no arbitrary limits on number handling.

## Core Principles

1. **No Arbitrary Limits**: The universe handles numbers of any size naturally
2. **Sequential Axiomatical Construction**: Each layer completed before the next begins
3. **Interface-Based Architecture**: Higher layers only use lower layer interfaces
4. **Complete Validation**: Each layer fully tested and verified before proceeding
